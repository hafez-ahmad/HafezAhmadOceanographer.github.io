										Coastal zone management means the distribution and allocation of coastal resources
to alternative uses or activities that may benefit community and nature.
by Geo-spatial technology means by the integration of all methods and tools that can be useful to 
establish a decision support system for spatial management.
The  system  needs  the  following  components: 
<ol>
 <li> GIS,  </li>
  <li>Data  analysis  </li>
  <li>Image  processing</li>
  <li>Modeling </li>
  <li>Expert  systems</li> 
  <li>Simulation  </li>
  <li>optimization  </li>
  <li>and  a  suitable User Interface.</li>

										GIS have the potential for significantly enhancing data management efforts in the coastal zone since:
much of the coastal data are spatial in nature;
<br>
1. GIS are sophisticated and fast-responding tools for decision makers, with the capability to incorporate a wide variety of data sources including remotely sensed imagery;
<br>
2. GIS contribute to the better understanding of links between the sea and the land processes in the coastal zone by supporting statistical analysis, modeling and impact assessments;
<br>
3. most significantly, GIS actually create new forms of information from the same data set rather than just retrieve previously encoded information.

									<p> <b> Coastal zone mapping and further analysis using Satellite Imageries </b> </p>
									<br>
									<p> Coastal and marine ecosystems serve key roles for carbon storage, nutrients and materials cycling, as well as reservoirs of biodiversity. 
								They also provide ecosystems services such as sustenance for millions of people,


								coastal protection against wave action, and recreational activities.
								Remote sensing of coastal and marine ecosystems is particularly challenging.
								
								<br>
								<b> we can use satellite Imageries for </b>

<li> Coastal zone management </li>
<li> coastal vegetation </li>
<li> shallow water Bathymetry  </li>
<li> Mangrove Mapping </li>
<li> shoreline extraction  </li>
<li>non forest [it is part main forest and its beginning to deforestation and smaller tree cover]</li>
<li> naf river coast [ study area covers small portion of naf river water and coast.] </li>

<b>I have done a project which is based on coastal land use ,land cover change and Modeling in the Rohingya camp ,teknaf , Bangladesh. </b> <br>
Around 919,000 Rohingya refugees live in southern Bangladesh, most of them in the vast and teeming camps and settlements that have sprung up in Cox’s Bazar district, close to the border with Myanmar.

A smaller number live in the neighbouring host communities of Teknaf and Ukhia. The majority – 700,000 arrived following the violence of late August 2017.

 The rest had arrived using the border in previous influxes. Bangladesh loses forests worth Tk1,800cr for Rohingya settlements. Bangladesh have already lost forest resources of about Tk 1,800 crore for hosting Rohingyas at Ukhiya and Teknaf 
 upazilas in Cox's Bazar, according to a Forest Department report.
 
I have added few map of image classification methods and  a project outputs.

										<p>  I have found a high resolution drone image about 9cm of 2018. it is just teknaf portion. I have classified using supervised algorithm (maximum likelihood)
 the class are

	<b> Classified Image land cover and classes </b>										
<li> inland water body </li>
<li> camp [shelter for Rohingya]</li>
<li> bare soil [it includes all deforested area , salt pan and normal bare soil  ]</li>

<li> forest [it is original forest] </li>
<li>non forest [it is part main forest and its beginning to deforestation and smaller tree cover]</li>
