												<h3>Nature conservation and Ocean Literacy</h3>
												<p> Nature Conservation is important for many reasons, not least of all to the health of the planet. However, the study of the subject goes merely beyond health and ecosystems.
													I like to work with Nature and Nature based solutions projects. I did some conservation stuffs and Research in the coastal area of Bangladesh and

												<h3>Programming and Mapping </h3>
												<p>Many oceanographers grow up loving the sea and its creatures. but when It comes in Data analysis and Modeling , you have to gain programming knowledge. fortran is widely used langauge in ocean Model. then 
												During the last couple of decades, Matlab has been the most commonly-used scripting language in physical oceanography, and it has a large user base in many other fields.
													
												<br> Recently, however, Python has been gaining ground, often being adopted by former Matlab users as well as by newcomers.<b> I have excellent working skill of  Python ,Julia , R , Matlab, FORTRAN. ArcGIS , QGIS,SAGA,GRASS </b>.<br> you can find more in github repo</p>

												<h3>Traveling </h3> 
												<p> I love traveling. Traveling makes you more open and accepting .
													If you travel, you will not only learn about foreign cultures,
													but about your own as well. You will notice the cultural differences,
													and will find out what makes your culture unique. After retrurning from a long journey, 
													you will see your country with new eyes. I have visitied United States of America, Washington DC,
													FLORIDA,New YORK ,Dubai,Qatar,Memphis,Birmingham,Athens, Saint Martin island , Cox'S bazar,sunburbans Mangrove.</p>

											<h4> Field working in the Keys Marine Laboratory ,Florida , USA</h4>
											<br>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/dive1.jpg" alt="" /></a> 
											<br>
											
											The Keys Marine Laboratory (KML) is a full-service marine field station situated in the heart of the Florida Keys.
											I I have spent three days  there and done a lot of field works,lab works and research under the supervision of  Dr. Douglass. 
											We dived into the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean and Identified Seagrass,Marine fishes and Coral reefs species.
											<br>
											<h4> Working in the Marine Ecology Lab</h4>
											<p>This is Dr. Douglass's Ecological lab.  I  spent about 86 hours in the last fall 2019 semester.
											I worked on Benthic Samples and sorting with four graduate students of the Florida Gulf Coast University.</p>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/dive2.jpg" alt="" /></a> 
											<br>
											
											<h4> Leadership program </h4>
											<p>The Social leadership Hackathon is a half-day workshop where students from diverse backgrounds can come together to
												learn and exercise leadership to solve a problem in their community.
Participants will work in small groups to focus on a particular local problem and work together as a team to create an action plan to solve it.</p>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/dive3.jpg" alt="" /></a>

											<h4> Atlantic Ocean ! </h4>
											<p> I love Oceand and its Weather. I dived into the Ocean. </p>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/dive4.jpg" alt="" /></a> 
											<br>
											<br>
											<h4> Snorkeling in the Gulf of Mexico</h4>
											<p>This was part of our Marine Ecology course. we collected fish and seagrass samples from different spots
												of the Gulf of Mexico. then We identified all of them at the Laboratory. </p>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/dive5.jpg" alt="" /></a> 
											<br>
											<br>
											<h4> Community Ecology </h4>
											<p> Community Ecology :study of the interactions between species, such as mutualism, predation and competition, and the dynamics and structure of the community.
												I did some analyses on Nonmetric multidimensional scaling using R.
											</p>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic44_communityecology.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<br>
											<h4> CNN_MarineMammal_Prediction </h4>
											<p> This is a basic Marine Mammal and Sharks detection-based on convolutional neural network model from static images. The classification stage is now complete; after some months, I will update the entire code for mammal and shark detections.

												At first , I used VGG-19 pretrained CNN model, then I built a new simple CNN model.
												
												
								The convolutional Neural Network CNN works by getting an image, designating it some weightage based on the different objects of the image, and then distinguishing them from each other.</p>

											<h3>Ocean Simulation Modeling</h3>
											<p>Ocean models are numerical models with a focus on the properties of oceans and their circulation. Ocean models play a large role 
												in aiding our understanding of the ocean's influence on weather and 
												climate.I love to work in the Ocean Modeling . I have little experience in Regional Ocean Modeling system 
												
												
by scientists to better understand the earth climate system.

											<b> Why do we need to Model Ocean? </b> <br>
Ocean models play a large role in aiding our understanding of the ocean’s influence on weather and climate. 
They are a repository for mechanistic theories of how the ocean works with numerical methods used to transform the mathematical expression of the theories into
 a computational tool for scientific investigations. In particular numerical models are for hypothesis-driven experimental and theoretical studies that 
				make them an essential tool in the hierarchy of methods used 
by scientists to better understand the earth climate system.</p>

  <b>Ecological Modeling</b> <br>
  <p> Ecosystem modeling is the mathematical representation of ecological systems from individuals to the whole biome 
  which is studied to understand the real nature, the models can be analytic or simulations based.
  It has applications in a wide variety of disciplines.

			 their contribution to the carbon export to the deep ocean are yet to be quantified.Eddies exist principally in the western Bay of Bengal and most of them propagate westward. The polarity distribution of eddies shows cyclones prefer to occur in the northwest and south of the Bay of Bengal,

											<h2>GIS and Remote sensing </h2>
											<p>Remote Sensing (RS) has a wide range of applications in the field of physical, biological, coastal, and satellite oceanography. RS in Oceanographic research is the collection of oceanographic, monitoring of coastal and oceanic processes data, and analysis of various processes using space-borne and airborne sensors. </p>
										
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											
											<p>Each year in Bangladesh about 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 sq mi) (around 18% of the country) is flooded, killing over 5,000 people and destroying more than seven million homes. During severe floods the affected area may exceed 75% of the country, as was seen in 1998. This volume is 95% of the total annual inflow.

it  is enriched with numerous marine biotic and abiotic resources including many species of commercial fishes,

												usually trained with the “bagging” method (Breiman, 2001).This algorithm is used for satellite image classification using google earth engine and landsat 8 imageries. 
												Breiman proposed RF in 2001 for classification and clustering. RF grows many decision trees for classification. 
												To classify a new object, the input vector is run through each decision tree in the forest</p>

											<p>Predicted Seagrass across the world shallow ocean with Machine learning method ( Python3 package:- scikit learn). Alaskan pollock is one of the important species for commercial fishing in the north pacific ocean supporting various fisheries. To fish both efficiently and sustainably, 
												it is important to understand where shoals are most likely to be located. I am trying to apply geostatistics and build a model to temperature data to predict where to find them in the Bering Sea<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hafez-ahmad-37a49b102_quarantinedays-stayabratabrhome-stayproductive-activity-6655075531408666625-B_gJ">here the Link </a>.</p>
