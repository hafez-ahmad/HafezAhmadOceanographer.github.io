										Marine ecosystems cover the largest aquatic system in the world covering more then 70 percent of the planet. Marine ecosystems are considered to be the habitats that complete 
										the larges system from the shores to the dark sea floor. The marine ecosystem includes: marshes, tidal zones, 
										estuaries, the mangrove forest, lagoons, sea grass beds, the sea floor, and the coral reefs.
										Marine ecosystems are an important part of the world, because the marine ecosystems give marine life such as:
										tiny plankton, fish, crustaceans, invertebrates, reptiles, marine mammals, sharks, and rays a place to live and survive
										<br>
										The marine environment has a very high biodiversity because 32 out of the 33 described animal phyla are represented in there.

									Marine ecosystem comprised of microscopic life to top predators that provide resources and services which are key to the health and wellbeing of human society. Coastal areas are generally rich in marine ecosystems and biodiversity as well as centers of economic activities including fishing, shipping, mariculture, tourism, and recreation, etc. so predicting these ecosystem states on sub-seasonal to interannual timescale is getting top priority.

Understanding and quantitatively describing marine ecosystems requires the integration of physics, chemistry, and biology. Coupling biology and physical oceanography in models has many attractive feature. We can do experiments with models of marine systems while the real system can only be observed in the state at the time of the observation. We can also employ the predictive potential of models for applications such as environmental management or experimental simulations. 

The ecosystem modeling is the mathematical representation of ecological systems ranging from individual population to entire biome which is studied to better understand and prediction about the dynamics of the real ecosystem. More specifically, ecosystem models are a computer that consists of algorithms that represents a set of important ecological processes to compute ecosystem dynamics over time.
Ecosystem models can be characterized roughly by their complexity for example by the number of state variables and the degree of process resolution.
Models enable researchers to simulate large scale over a very long periodâ€™s experiments that would be costly in the real world. Ecosystem modeling requires the combination of both the biological and the physical system. The physical feature of a system shapes the potential range of the chemical-biological developments. Obvious examples of physical determinants are the yearly cycle and range of temperature, typical mixing, depths, and vertical stratification as well as transport and distribution of nutrients due to advection and turbulent diffusion. Inhomogeneous physical forcing provides scales that need to be resolved in models for many applications. Strong spatial gradients in the biogeochemical variables also require adequate spatial resolution.

										
<b> Ecological Modeling Tools:</b>

1: Marine Geospatial Ecology Tools (MGET)
MGET is an open source geoprocessing toolbox that can solve a wide range of marine research, conservation and spatial planning problems. You can use it within ArcGIS [10.1 -10.5].
2:   Ecopath with Ecosim : Ecopath with Ecosim is a free and open source ecosystem modelling software suite, initially started at NOAA by Jeffrey Polovina, but has since primarily been developed at the formerly UBC Fisheries Centre of the University of British Columbia.
